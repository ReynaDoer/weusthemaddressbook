I attempted to build the address book with react but realized I wasn't going to be able to produce much having only used it a couple times.  I decided to use flask and python to program a very basic address book as I have more experience and understanding with them.  I wasn't able to get all of the functions working with the time I had left so you'll see that only the add contact is working properly and the delete and update are incomplete.

To run the program cd to the scripts directory using comand prompt and the run:

export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser window and you will be able to access the address book.

Was definitely not exactly what you asked for but I thought I'd give it a try! Thanks for the opportunity.
